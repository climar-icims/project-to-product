## Stop Developing Software
# Start Engineering *Experiences*

# 👋🏽 Sup? I'm Carlos.

+ 10 years at iCIMS
    - Joined as **UI Developer**
    - Principal Software Engineer

+ 20+ years of *experience* developing software

Notes: I'm Carlos, I've been at iCIMS for 10 years now. I started as a UI Developer and now I'm a Principal Software Engineer but like to think of it more as Experience Engineer.
Currently on the UX Team, we build the iCIMS Design System and internal dev tools. I've been developing software for over 20 years now.

### *Talent Powers Transformation*

# ![Bertie](/img/Bertie_hi.gif)

Notes: iCIMS is a Talent Cloud company that provides cloud-based software that helps companies attract, engage, hire, and advance the best talent.

# From Project to Product

Notes: My original presentation was going to be about improving the *Product Experience* as it selfishly was a chance for me to get some extra time to learn something I was interested in that grew out of my research for adding Pendo/Gainsight integration.

# What is Product Experience (PX)?

**Product experience** is the overall impression and satisfaction a customer has when interacting with a product or service. It encompasses factors such as design, usability, functionality, and customer support.

Notes: In essence, it's how a customer feels about a product, from the initial discovery to the post-purchase experience.

That's cool, but...

## Wait a minutes...

Notes: Sounds famliar...

# What is User Experience (UX)?

**User experience (UX)** is the overall impression and satisfaction a user has when interacting with a product, system, or service. It encompasses factors such as usability, accessibility, and overall satisfaction. In simpler terms, it's how easy and enjoyable it is for a user to accomplish their goals using a product or service.

Notes: Sounds familiar, right? That's because product experience is essentially a broader version of user experience, encompassing the entire product or service, not just the user interface.

---

# What is Customer experience (CX)?

**Customer experience** is the overall impression and satisfaction a customer has when interacting with a company, its products, or services. It encompasses all aspects of the customer journey, from initial awareness to post-purchase support.

Notes: In simpler terms, it's how a customer feels about a brand and its offerings, from the moment they first hear about it to the long-term relationship they develop.

---

# What is Employee experience (EX)?

**Employee experience (EX)** is the sum of all the interactions and experiences an employee has with an organization. It encompasses everything from the hiring process to the day-to-day work environment, company culture, management relationships, opportunities for growth and development, and overall job satisfaction.

Notes: A positive employee experience leads to higher engagement, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. It can also improve employee retention and attract top talent.

---

# What is developer experience (DevEx)?

**Developer experience (DevEx)** is the overall quality of a developer's interaction with their work environment, encompassing tools, processes, and organizational culture. It focuses on creating a seamless, efficient, and enjoyable environment for software development.   

Notes: Essentially, it's about making the developer's life easier and more productive. A good DevEx leads to happier developers, better code quality, and FASTER product delivery.
Also should allow an environment that allows for lots of experimenting and failing.

# It's all about the experience

# "The only source of knowledge is experience"
#### &mdash; Albert Einstien

Notes: Experience is the best teacher. It's the only way to truly learn and grow.
More experience = the more you know = better understanding of how to create a good experience

---

# "Experience is a good school. But the fees are high."
#### &mdash; Heinrich Heine

Notes: BUT! So we want more experiences, but at a discount. One way to reduce the price of experience is to bake it in.

---

# Can we hack experience?

# The "Experience" Mindset

- Every interaction is an experience or oppertunity to learn.
- Don't be afraid to abandon features and processes that are not adding value or distracting from your focus.
- Don't be afraid to deliver... a lot!

Notes: It's better to deliver a lot of small incremental improvements, fixes and features over time.
Don't plan too far ahead, instead guide your roadmap based on feedback and test results from the small deliveries.

---

# DevExp

It starts with the Developer Experience that allows for lots of experimenting while costing or negativly impacting as little people as possible.

Notes: The best way to make experiences cheap is a to invest upfront in a great developer experience.
By building your writing and stratically seperating concerns and features from the core and business logic can go a long way.

---

## Document Everything!

- Use a wiki or knowledge base to document processes, best practices, and guidelines.
- Use code comments and documentation to explain complex code and logic.
- Use README files to explain how to set up and run the project.

Notes: The more documentation you have the easier it is for new developers to get up to speed and for existing developers to remember how things work.
Follow best practices and guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability. README file, CONTRIBUTION file, etc.

Documentation can also be generated and updated automatically with tools like Swagger, JSDoc, etc.

---

## Monitor Everything!

- Use logging and monitoring tools to track errors and performance.
- Set up alerts for critical issues.
- Use dashboards to visualize key metrics.
- Use synthetic and real user monitoring to track performance and user experience.

Notes: The more you know about how your application is performing the better you can make it. Also allows you to set baseline performance metrics and actual data to back up your decisions.

---

## Analyze *Everything*!

- Use analytics to track user behavior and engagement.
- Set baseline &amp; goals for key metrics.
- Use A/B testing to compare different versions of a feature or design.
    - Heatmaps, session recordings, and user flow analysis.
    - Use surveys and feedback to gather insights from users.

---

## Automate Everything

* Use Git
* Automate, automate, automate testing and deployment- Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, etc.
* **Enforce gates like high code coverage, linting, and security checks.**
* Add a staging enviroment for testing and QA.

Notes: This The more confident developers are that their code won't break production the more willing they will be to experiment and test their code before it's 100% ready. 
Source control also allows for rolling back or pinning down who/what/when something was introduced to the code for troubleshooting purposes.

At iCIMS we use Jenkins for our CI/CD pipeline and Bitbucket for our source control.

---

## Seperate Everythings *jk*

* Look for opportunities to break up monolithic codebases into smaller, more manageable pieces.
* Use microservices or serverless architecture to decouple components.
* Use containers and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes to manage deployments.

---
## Feature
* Every new feature should be behind a feature flag.
* Isolate and modularize features &amp; functionality.
* Don't do it all at once, phase rollouts!

Notes: By isolating and delivering features behind feature flags devs can release incomplete or work-in-progress that will only be seen or effect a smaller subset of users.
Groups or tiers of 'beta' testers could be targeted to first see and give feedback on the newest features in the earlier portions of the tests until bugs are ironed out
or immediately disabled/turned off if an issue is found or rolled out to more users as the feature matures or passes certain thresholds.

By phasing rollouts and testing you can also gather feedback and data on how the feature is being used and how it's performing. Delivering the more complete polished work to the bigger more critical clients.
